## üëã Hello! I'm Yudong Chun, with a strong interest in generative models and computer vision.

I'm currently focused on multimodal video generation and 3D-aware perception models.  
My work combines vision, language, and spatial understanding to build AI systems that help people express and communicate ideas freely.

## üß© Projects

### 1. [Video-to-Text / Text-to-Frame Retrieval (with TVING)](https://github.com/chunyudong/level2-cv-final-cv-08)  
Focused on building the **text-to-frame retrieval pipeline** using CLIP and InternVL-2.5.  
Performed **VLM-based labeling**, **VLM evaluation**, and **data cleansing** to improve semantic alignment.  
Part of a corporate collaboration with TVING.

### 2. [Hand Bone Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/chunyudong/level2-cv-semanticsegmentation-cv-11-lv3)  
Performed **EDA**, **data augmentation**, and applied **mixed precision training** to optimize training efficiency.  
Tuned key hyperparameters to improve segmentation accuracy.

### 3. [Multilingual Receipt OCR (Data-Centric)](https://github.com/chunyudong/level2-cv-datacentric-cv-08)  
Conducted **EDA**, **data augmentation**, and **fine-tuning** for OCR model improvement.  
Focused on **data-centric optimization** by tuning hyperparameters and enhancing multilingual coverage.

### 4. [Object Detection for Recycling Classification](https://github.com/chunyudong/level2-objectdetection-cv-08)  
Led **EDA**, **data augmentation**, and **YOLO model training**.  
Applied **TURTLE (unsupervised transfer learning)** to re-cluster diverse general trash data, improving mAP@50 from 0.563 ‚Üí 0.609.  
Also performed **hyperparameter tuning** and fine-tuning for performance optimization.

### 5. [Sketch Image Data Classification](https://github.com/chunyudong/level1-imageclassification-cv-08)  
Performed **EDA**, **data augmentation**, and **hyperparameter tuning** for CNN-based sketch classification.
